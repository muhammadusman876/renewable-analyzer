## 🔍 Project Concept

🔹 **User Input:**

- Location (city/postal code in Germany)
- Roof area (m²)
- Roof orientation (optional)
- Budget (optional)

🔹 **System Logic:**

1. **✅ Lookup weather & solar potential:**

   - ✅ **EDA Dataset**: 4,383 German weather records (2006-2017) integrated
   - ✅ **DWD API**: Real-time German weather service (Deutscher Wetterdienst)
   - ✅ **Location-based**: Geocoding and weather data for any German location

2. **✅ Estimate annual energy production:**

   - ✅ **Advanced Formula**: `Energy = Irradiance × Roof Area × Panel Efficiency × System Losses × Orientation Factor`
   - ✅ **Realistic Output**: Fixed calculations (18,250 kWh vs previous 10M+ bug)
   - ✅ **Monthly Breakdown**: Seasonal production patterns and capacity factors

3. **✅ Estimate cost savings:**

   - ✅ **Live Electricity Prices**: Real-time German electricity price API with 24h updates
   - ✅ **Comprehensive ROI**: Payback period, annual savings, 25-year projections, CO2 reduction
   - ✅ **German Market Integration**: KfW financing, feed-in tariffs, VAT exemptions

4. **✅ LLM + RAG IMPLEMENTED:**

   - ✅ **Ollama LLM**: Local AI generating personalized feasibility reports
   - ✅ **FAISS Vector DB**: Semantic search through German energy policies
   - ✅ **Document Retrieval**: KfW programs, EEG 2023, regional incentives, technical guides
   - ✅ **Intelligent Reports**: Context-aware recommendations vs static templates

5. **🔄 Agent (partially implemented):**

   - ✅ **Live Price Agent**: LangChain tool for real-time electricity prices
   - ✅ **Background Updates**: Automatic price refresh every 24 hours
   - 🚧 **Future Enhancement**: Could add real-time subsidy lookup agents

6. **🧠 AI Model Training & Fine-tuning (SLURM):**
   - 🎯 **Domain-Specific LLM**: Fine-tune Llama 7B on German solar reports dataset
   - ⚡ **University Cluster**: SLURM job scheduling for distributed training
   - 📊 **Custom Dataset**: Generate synthetic solar feasibility reports for training
   - 🔬 **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search optimization on cluster resources
   - 📈 **Performance Evaluation**: Compare fine-tuned vs base model performance

## 🔗 Architecture (Flow)

```
[ ReactJS Frontend ]
        |
   [ FastAPI Backend ]
        |
[ LangChain Pipeline ]
        |                     ↘︎
[ EDA Dataset / Vector DB ]   [ LLM API ]
        |
 [ Output: Feasibility Report JSON ]
```

✅ User → ReactJS → FastAPI → LangChain → RAG (weather + policies) → LLM generates text → backend sends to React → React shows report.
